    Special 2: Kiha lifts her axe overhead and then hurls it at you in a surprising feat of speed and strength. Not keen on getting cleaved in two, you sidestep the jagged metal.
    Hit: But when your attention refocuses on the dragoness, you realize she's right in front of you! She hits you in the face with a vicious straight punch, knocking you on your back.
    Miss: When your gaze returns to the dragoness, you realize she's right in front of you! Luckily your reflexes are good enough that you manage to duck under the incoming punch. By the time you've recovered, Kiha is already standing, battle-ready and axe in hand. (uh, no? in the time it takes the PC to unbend from a simple duck, she's already disentangled herself from close quarters, run over to where the axe landed on the opposite side of him, extracted it from whatever it may be stuck in, and toted it back to the player? do it again with sense; she should be stunned or disarmed for at least a turn if she misses -Z)

    Special 3: Kiha suddenly lets out a roar, swings her axe down and then charges headlong at you!
    Hit: Like a runaway boulder, the dragoness slams into you, brutally propelling you to the ground, jarring bone and leaving you dazed. //Stun effect applies for 2 rounds//
    Miss: You nimbly turn aside and roll her off your shoulder at the last moment, leaving her ploughing on uncontrollably until she (catches her foot in a sinkhole and twists her ankle painfully, faceplanting in the bog)/(slams headfirst into a half-rotten tree with a shower of mouldering splinters). She quickly rights herself and turns to face you, but it clearly took its toll on her. //Kiha takes damage//
